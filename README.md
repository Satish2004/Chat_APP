Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS/Tailwind CSS: For responsive and modern styling.
Backend
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side code.
Express.js: A fast, minimalistic web framework for Node.js.
Socket.io: A real-time communication library that enables bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
Database (Optional for storing users/messages)
MongoDB with Mongoose (if you're storing chat history or user info)
Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js
npm or yarn: Node.js package managers
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
Install dependencies:

Navigate to both the frontend and backend directories and install the necessary dependencies.

For the backend (Node.js):

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
For the frontend (React.js):

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Environment Setup:

Create a .env file in the backend directory to store environment variables like your database connection string, JWT secret, etc. Example:

bash
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
Running the Application:

Backend: Run the Node.js server

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm run start
Frontend: Start the React application

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Access the App:

Open the app in your browser:

bash
Copy code

How It Works
User Interface: Users can choose a username and join a chat room.
Socket Communication: The app establishes a connection using Socket.io between the client and server. Messages are transmitted instantly between users.
Real-Time Updates: Whenever a user sends a message, all other users in the same room receive the message instantly without reloading the page.
Additional Features:
Typing indicators are sent through Socket.io events.
Notifications are displayed when a new message arrives.
